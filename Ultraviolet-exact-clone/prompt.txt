In Ultraviolet-exact-clone, create a fully functional clone of Ultraviolet Proxy in python. This should have no lack of functionality than the actual Ultraviolet. Please look at the actual source code of ultraviolet so you can see exactly how it handles errors and functions. It should run with almost all websites (including google, which I know is hard, but i believe in you). Do not slack on this project, no matter how big of a project or how long it takes. If a human caan do this in JavaScript, than certanly you can do this in Python. Do not read or change any files that are outside of the ultravilet-exact-clone folder. Now get working!
